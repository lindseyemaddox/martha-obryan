			<h2>Whistleblower Policy</h2>

			<h3>Need a subhead</h3>

			<p> If any employee reasonably believes that some policy, practice, or activity of the Center is in violation of law, a written complaint may be filed by that employee with the Chief Executive Officer.</p>

			<p>It is the intent of the Center to adhere to all laws and regulations that apply to the organization, and the underlying purpose of this policy is to support the organization's goal of legal compliance. The support of all employees is necessary to achieving compliance with various laws and regulations. An employee is protected from retaliation only if the employee brings the alleged unlawful activity, policy, or practice to the attention of the Center and provides the Center with a reasonable opportunity to investigate and correct the alleged unlawful activity. The protection described below is only available to employees that comply with this requirement.</p>

			<p>The Center will not retaliate against an employee who, in good faith, has made a protest or raised a complaint against some practice of the Center, or of another individual or entity with whom the Center had a business relationship, on the basis of a reasonable belief that the practice is in violation of law or a clear mandate of public policy.</p>

			<p>The Center will not retaliate against an employee who discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or a public body any activity, policy, or practice of the Center that the employee reasonably believes is in violation of a law, or a rule, or regulation mandated pursuant to law or is in violation of a clear mandate or public policy concerning health, safety, welfare, or protection of the environment.</p>
