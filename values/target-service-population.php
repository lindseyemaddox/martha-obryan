			<h2>Target Service Population</h2>

			<h3>Need a subhead</h3>

			<p>Income poverty means simply the lack of income or a shortage of material goods, but human poverty means much more. It can include the loss of dignity, a sense of powerlessness, a lack of autonomy and control, and the feeling of being marginalized or excluded politically, socially, or psychologically. The deprivation of what most of society considers necessary can result in the diminution of aspirations and achievements, especially for children in poverty who are very aware of what they are missing. (Metropolitan Social Services Community Needs Evaluation 2011 Update)</p>
 
			<p>East Nashville is a neighborhood unlike any other in the Nashville area. With nationally recognized small businesses and restaurants, our community is a beacon of creativity, diversity, and acceptance; but ours is also a neighborhood where over 60% of high school students read on a sixth grade level or below, 9 of 10 children do not attend college, unemployment is 15% above the Davidson County average, and the drop out rate is 23% above the county average.</p>
 
			<p>East Nashville is geographically isolated from the rest of the city by the Cumberland River and the interstate system. Imagine that feeling of isolation as an every day occurrence, with no end date on the calendar. This is the reality for many of our neighbors in living in poverty.</p>
 
			<p>Since 1894, the Martha O’Bryan Center has provided resources to individuals and families, empowering them to achieve independence and success. We believe that communities are healthiest when parents are working and children are succeeding in schools. Thanks to our supporters, volunteers, partners and the families we serve, we are together changing the expectations of achievement and engagement for all in East Nashville. We are breaking the line.</p>
 
			<p>Currently, Martha O'Bryan Center serves primarily children, youth, and families living in and around Cayce Place, Nashville's oldest and largest public housing development. It is also one of the poorest, with an average annual household income of $6,175. Cayce Place comprises 710 rental units with 2,400 residents crowded onto 63 acres. 88% of the population is African American; 89% of households are headed by a single woman; 59% of the residents are children under the age of 18.</p>
 
			<p>We also serve families from the CWA Plaza Apartments, a development that houses 803 residents, 55% of whom are under the age of 18, and a large number of single-parent, female heads of households. A rapidly increasing immigrant population also characterizes these apartments with approximately 35% being Somali or Sudanese. </p>
 
			<p>Children from these families attend Maplewood and Stratford clusters, schools which are economically disadvantaged within the Metro Nashville School Systems. These schools have difficulties keeping students on track with literacy skills, reporting that 10% are below proficiency in reading and language and higher among ESL students. Nearly 25% of the students at Stratford High School do not graduate on time. Only 9% of males and 10% of females in our neighborhood complete post-secondary education—not even half as many as the national average which is 27% for males and 23% for females.</p>
